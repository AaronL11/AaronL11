## About me

I am a seasoned competitive programmer who's coached at the international level and has also taught algorithms and data structures at the university level. I have experience contributing to various software projects while also being proficient in two programming languages with a strong mathematical background. My interests include functional programming, pure mathematics, and gaming. I love solving challenging and complex problems in clever and creative ways, mostly using mathematics and computer science concepts.
